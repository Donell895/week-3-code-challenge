# week-3-code-challenge
A project on Movie Details including its poster, title, runtime,
   showtime, and available tickets when the page loads. The number of
   available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of
   `tickets_sold` from the theater's `capacity`. You will need to make a GET
   request to the following endpoint to retrieve the film data:

 Example Response:
   {
     "id": "1",
     "title": "The Giant Gila Monster",
     "runtime": "108",
     "capacity": 30,
     "showtime": "04:00PM",
     "tickets_sold": 27,
     "description": "A giant lizard terrorizes a rural Texas community and a heroic teenager attempts to destroy the creature.",
     "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/2157/p2157_v_v8_ab.jpg"
   }
